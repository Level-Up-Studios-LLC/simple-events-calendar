A simple, responsive events calendar plugin for WordPress that integrates seamlessly with Advanced Custom Fields.

== Description ==

Simple Events Calendar is a lightweight, user-friendly events management plugin that creates beautiful, responsive event displays on your WordPress site. Built specifically to work with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), it provides a clean and intuitive way to manage and display events.

= Key Features =

* **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
* **Advanced Custom Fields Integration**: Seamlessly works with ACF Free or Pro
* **Infinite Scroll Loading**: Events load smoothly as users scroll down
* **Flexible Display Options**: Control what event information to show (time, excerpt, location, etc.)
* **Event Status Filtering**: Filter events by upcoming, today's events, or past events in admin
* **Clean Shortcode**: Simple `[sec_events]` shortcode with customizable parameters
* **Modern Build System**: SCSS compilation with development and production builds
* **Accessibility Ready**: Built with accessibility best practices and reduced motion support

= Shortcode Usage =

Display events anywhere on your site with the simple shortcode:

`[sec_events]`

= Shortcode Parameters =

* `posts_per_page` - Number of events to load initially (default: 6)
* `show_time` - Display event time (default: true)
* `show_excerpt` - Display event excerpt (default: true)
* `show_location` - Display event location (default: true)
* `show_footer` - Display event footer (default: true)

Example: `[sec_events posts_per_page="9" show_time="false"]`

= Required Plugin =

This plugin requires Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) to be installed and activated. It works with both the free and pro versions of ACF.

= Developer Features =

* SCSS build system with Sass compiler
* CSS linting with stylelint
* File watching for development
* Automated distribution creation
* Semantic versioning support

Additional languages can be added using standard WordPress translation methods.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/simple-events-calendar` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Install and activate Advanced Custom Fields (Free or Pro) if not already installed.
3. Activate the Simple Events Calendar plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
4. The plugin will automatically create the necessary custom fields for events.
5. Start creating events in your WordPress admin under "Events".
6. Use the `[sec_events]` shortcode to display events on any page or post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need Advanced Custom Fields Pro? =

No, the plugin works with both ACF Free and ACF Pro. However, ACF (Free or Pro) is required for the plugin to function.

= Can I customize the event display? =

Yes, the plugin includes several shortcode parameters to control what information is displayed. You can also customize the styling through your theme's CSS.

The plugin displays 6 events initially and loads 6 more events each time the user scrolls to the bottom (infinite scroll).
